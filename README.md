# CS50 Final Project 
## HUGR by Duarte Reis

**HUGR** is a web-based application whose purpose is to aid anyone who might be feeling lost, dissoriented or let down in life, and that have trouble figuring ou what to do in order to change that.
The website provides a method often used in life coaching called the life wheel. It is a *graphical representation* of all the areas of one's life (simplified, of course).
**HUGR** leads the user through the method until they have made a multi-step plan towards achieving an hopefully impactful change.

This application requires you to create an account and log in. It saves all your current plans annd your current life wheel, which can be updated at anytime.

This web-based application uses HTML, CSS, Python (Flask and Jinja), JScript and SQLlite. It was completed November 22nd 2020.
